# Testity

####What is Testity?
Testity is more than just a library. Testity is a custom workflow for .Net class library projects that target games engines such as: Unity3D and UnrealEngine 4 (when C# bindings are implemented).

####Goals

*Primary*
* Allow for the creation of unit testable, or generally testable, game logic.
* Support practices of inversion of control and dependency injection.

*Secondary*
* Allow for the creation of engine agnostic game logic.
